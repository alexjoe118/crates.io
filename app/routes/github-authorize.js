 * This route will be called from the GitHub OAuth flow once the user has
 * accepted or rejected the data access permissions. It will forward the
 * temporary `code` received from the GitHub API to our own API server which
 * will exchange it for an access token.
 *
 * After the exchange the API will return an API token and the user information.
 * The result will be stored and the popup window closed. The `/login` route
 * will then continue to evaluate the response.
