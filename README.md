# crates.io

Source code for the default [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io) registry. Viewable 
online at [crates.io](https://crates.io).

This project is built on ember-cli and cargo, visit
[iamstef.net/ember-cli](http://ember-cli.com/) or
[doc.crates.io](http://doc.crates.io/) respectively for more information.

## Working on the Frontend

```
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io.git
cd crates.io/
npm install
npm install -g ember-cli bower
bower install
```

The website's frontend is built with [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/). This 
makes it possible to work on the frontend without running a local backend.
To start the frontend run:

```bash
npm run start:staging
```

This will run a local frontend using the staging backend (hosted on Heroku at 
[staging-crates-io.herokuapp.com](https://staging-crates-io.herokuapp.com)).

If you'd like to run the frontend with a specific backend endpoint, you can 
specify arguments to `npm start`. For example you can set the proxy to 
`https://crates.io/` to use the production version. 

**Note: it is also possible to make changes to the production data**

To do this, run:

```bash
npm start -- --proxy https://crates.io
#Â or
npm run start:live
```

**Note**: This requires npm 2.

### Running Tests

Install [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/), typically: `npm install 
phantomjs-prebuilt`.

Then run the tests with:

```
ember test
ember test --server
```

## Working on the Backend

After cloning the repo, steps for setting up the backend API server are as 
follows:

1. Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and change any applicable values as
    directed by the comments in the file. Make sure the values in your new
    `.env` are exported in the shell you use for the following commands.

2. Set up the git index:

    ```
    ./script/init-local-index.sh
    ```

    But *do not* modify your `~/.cargo/config` yet. Do that after step 3.

3. Build the server:

    ```
    cargo build
    ```

    On OS X 10.11, you will need to install the openssl headers first, and tell
    cargo where to find them. See https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl#osx.

4. Run the migrations:

    ```
    ./target/debug/migrate
    ```

5. Start the backend server:

    ```
    ./target/debug/server
    ```

6. **Optionally** start a local frontend:

    ```
    npm run start:local
    ```

### Running Tests

1. Configure the location of the test database. Note that this should just be a
   blank database, the test harness will ensure that migrations are run.

    ```
    export TEST_DATABASE_URL=...
    ```

2. Set the s3 bucket to `alexcrichton-test`. No actual requests to s3 will be
   made; the requests and responses are recorded in files in
   `tests/http-data` and the s3 bucket name needs to match the requests in the
   files.

    ```
    export S3_BUCKET=alexcrichton-test
    ```

3. Run the backend API server tests:

    ```
    cargo test
    ```

## Deploying & Using a Mirror

**DISCLAIMER: The process of setting up a mirror is a work-in-progress and is
likely to change. It is not currently recommended for mission-critical
production use. It also requires a version of cargo newer than 0.13.0-nightly
(f09ef68 2016-08-02); the version of cargo currently on rustc's beta channel
fulfils this requirement and will be shipped with rustc 1.12.0 scheduled to be
released on 2016-09-29.**

### Current functionality: a read-only, download-API-only mirror

This mirror will function as a read-only duplicate of crates.io's API. You will
be able to download crates using your index and your mirror, but the crate files
will still come from crates.io's S3 storage.

Your mirror will not:

- Allow users to sign up/sign in
- Allow crate publish
- Keep track of any statistics
- Display available crates in its UI

### API server setup

To deploy the API on Heroku, use this button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)][deploy]

[deploy]: https://heroku.com/deploy

The only config variable you need to set is `GIT_REPO_URL`, which should be the
git URL of your crates index repository; see the next section for setup
instructions for that.

### Index Mirror Setup

You also need a mirror of the crates.io git index, and your index needs to point
to your API server.

1. `git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index.git`
2. Edit the config.json file to point to your API server so it looks like:

    ```json
    {
      "dl": "https://[your heroku app name].herokuapp.com/api/v1/crates",
      "api": "https://[your heroku app name].herokuapp.com/"
    }
    ```

3. Commit and push to wherever you will be hosting your index (ex: github,
    gitlab, an internal git server)

4. In order to keep your mirror index up to date, schedule a `git pull` of the
    official index. How to do this depends on how you are hosting your index,
    but could be done through `cron` or a scheduled CI job, for example.

### Local Cargo Setup

**NOTE: The following configuration requires a cargo version newer than
0.13.0-nightly (f09ef68 2016-08-02). The version of cargo that comes with rust
1.12.0 fulfils this requirement; this version is currently on the beta channel
and is scheduled to be released on 2016-09-29.**

In the project where you want to use your mirror, change your `.cargo/config`
to replace the crates.io source to point to your crates index:

```toml
[source]

[source.mirror]
registry = "https://[host and path to your git server]/crates.io-index"

[source.crates-io]
replace-with = "mirror"
registry = 'https://doesnt-matter-but-must-be-present'
```

Once [rust-lang/cargo#3089](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/3089) is
released, it won't be necessary to specify a registry URL for a source being
replaced.
